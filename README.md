Do you want to know what type of relationship(friendship,love,affection,marriage,enemy,sister) 
you are going to have with your dream partner?

How To Play

The rules of the FLAMES game can be described as follows. Take the names of two people, usually of opposite genders,
and cross out all the common letters in the two names. Count the total number of letters that remain in both names after
this procedure. Let this number of mismatches be m.Now write FLAMES on a piece of paper. Count through the letters of this
string starting from F to S and cycling back through F till m letters have been counted. At this point, cross out the letter
in FLAMES at which the count ends (say A). Restart counting from the next letter (here M) through the string FLMES. Repeat
this till ﬁve of the letters of FLAMES have been crossed out and only one letter remains.The final letter that remains is 
the predicted nature of the relationship between the two people whose names were initially chosen, where F = “Friend”,
L = “Love”, A = “Affection”, M = “Marriage”, E = “Enemy”, S = “Sibling”. The rationale (or the lack of it) for these
interpretations is beyond the scope of this repository.
